Note : This Project is just a practice on how to make a somple game
using some c++ with SDL2.0 library and so far those are the steps 
I accomplished :

    -Establishing the engine for the game (Game Loop)
    - Setting up the SDL Window and Renderer
    - Creating the required classes to control the game objects

current task : Parsing the map
