Thank you for downloading my tileset.

I really hope you like it and that it suits your needs.

Each of the sprites is 32x32 pixels in size.

In the tileset it has offset 2px and padding 2px.

It is recommended to slice the tileset in Unity as Grid by Cell Size with the following settings
-Pixel Size : X32 Y32
-Offset: X2 Y2
-Padding X2 Y2

You can use this resource for any project type.
